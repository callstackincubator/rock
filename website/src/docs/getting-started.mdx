# Getting Started

Choose your path based on your current situation:

## New React Native Project

:::info Consider Expo First
For **new projects**, we recommend starting with [Expo](https://expo.dev) for the best developer experience and similar remote caching capabilities. Use [this template](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/expo-app-template) for sensible defaults. Rock is designed for teams who have outgrown the Community CLI.
:::

To create a new React Native project with Rock:

<PackageManagerTabs command="create rock@latest" />

The command will ask you to pick your preferred bundler and platforms.

## Migrate from Community CLI

If you have an existing React Native project using Community CLI:

<PackageManagerTabs command="create rock@latest" />

This will automatically detect your existing project and guide you through the migration process.

:::warning Automatic Migration Issues?
If automatic migration doesn't work for your project, check the [detailed migration guide](/docs/cli/migrating-from-community-cli) for manual instructions.
:::

## Add to Existing Native Project

For iOS/Android teams wanting to add React Native to existing apps, see our [Brownfield documentation](/docs/brownfield/intro) for step-by-step instructions.

## Usage

Now that you have Rock configured, you should be able to use Metro's or Re.Pack's development server and bundle your application.

### Running development server

When developing your application, you'll need to run a dev server that will use a bundler like Metro or Re.Pack to bundle your JS and later serve it to an app running on a device or simulator.

To start the development server, run:

<PackageManagerTabs command="rock start" />

### Running the iOS app

To build and run your app on an iOS simulator or device, run the `run:ios` command:

<PackageManagerTabs command="rock run:ios" />

### Running the Android app

To build and run your app on an Android emulator or device, run the `run:android` command:

<PackageManagerTabs command="rock run:android" />

### Running the HarmonyOS app (experimental)

To build and run your app on a HarmonyOS emulator or device, run the `run:harmony` command:

<PackageManagerTabs command="rock run:harmony" />
